  I enjoy solving problems that reside in the space where algorithms, programming and technology converge on the real world. The reward of watching technology come alive has had a great part in motivating the direction of my career towards a better understanding of how to make this happen. From a mathematics PhD to company as an algorithms developer, control engineer, software architect and product manager, these have all contributed to understanding a significant part of the pipeline involved in the development of technology solutions. This has more recently has allowed me to take part in shaping an environment to grow small teams tasked with the design and development of new products and technology solutions. My role is more specifically suited to that of a lead developer with enough experience (and a significant interest) in product and business development to be able to participate in the bigger picture.
